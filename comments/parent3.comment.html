This is the same as <b>Test cas 1</b> but we added a <b>'data-live-id':'whatever'</b> argument to child component call.
<br>
Have a look at the network connections in the Browser debug console.
<ul>
    <li>
        If you update the parent, the child is rendered as an empty div.
        <br>
        A single request is made for the parent. This is request executed by the change of the input in the parent component.
        No other request is executed. This is probably because the data-live-id doesn't change. But what about the <b>dataModel</b> and <b>animal</b> arguments of child component ?
        <br>
        <b>Bug</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        If you update the child, the parent is updated, but the child is rendered as an empty div.
        <br>
        A single request is made for the parent, without waiting for the debounce delay. I guess this is the request based on <b>dataModel</b> argument of child component.
        <br>
        <b>Bug</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        If you then update the parent or the child, the child is rendered and updated.
        <br>
        A single request is made for the parent.
        <br>
        <b>Semi Bug. By the way, at the next update, the child component will not be rendered correctly.</b>
    </li>
    <br>
</ul>
