Compared to <b>Test Case 1</b>, we have removed the <b>'animal': this.animal,</b> argument passed to child component
<br>
Have a look at the network connections in the Browser debug console.
<ul>
    <li>
        When you update the parent, the child <b>is not updated</b>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                A first request is made for the parent. This is the request based on data-model.
            </li>
            <li>
                No request is made for the child.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Problem :</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The child still has its <b>updateFromParent</b> property set to true.
            </li>
            <li>
                The child component is called with a <b>dataModel: 'animal:animal'</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no property passed to child component like <b>'animal': this.animal</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Is the behavior normal ? In my opinion, the simple fact that we have a <b>dataModel: 'animal:animal'</b>
        and an <b>updateFromParent</b> property implies that the 'animal' property should be automatically created
        without the need to add <b>'animal': this.animal,</b> in the child arguments.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        When you update the child, the parent is updated. It seems to work correctly, but the first request is not processed at the right moment :
        <ul>
            <li>
                A first request is made for the parent. This is the request based on data-model. (Request A)
            </li>
            <li>
                A second request is made for the child. This is the request based on the change of the input in the child. (Request B)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b><i>Nearly Perfect</i> ðŸ˜€ Problem :</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first request (A) should be executed <b><i>at least</i></b> after the change of the input is handled in the child (request B).
                I added a 5000ms debounce on the child input to highlight the problem.
                An appropriate way (in my opinion) would be, in the child, when input is changed :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Wait the debounce period.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Process request A.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Process request B.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
