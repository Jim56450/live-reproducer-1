Have a look at the network connections in the Browser debug console.

        When you update the parent, the child is updated.
        <ul>
            <li>
                A first request is made for the parent. This is the request based on data-model.
            </li>
            <li>
                A second one for the child. This is the request based on updateFromParent property.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Perfect !</b>
    </li>

        When you update the child, the parent is updated. It seems to work correctly, but not 3 (not 2) requests are processed :
        <ul>
            <li>
                A first request is made for the parent. This is the request based on data-model. (Request A)
            </li>
            <li>
                A second request is made for the child. This is the request based on updateFromParent property. (Request B)
            </li>
            <li>
                A third request is made for the child. This is the request based on the change of the input in the child. (Request C)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Problem :</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first request (A) should be executed <b><i>at least</i></b> after the change of the input is handled in the child (request C).
                I added a 5000ms debounce on the child input to highlight the problem.
                An appropriate way (in my opinion) would be, in the child, when input is changed :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Wait the debounce period.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Process request A.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Process request B.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suppress request C.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
